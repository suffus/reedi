# Post Image Scaling Fix

## Problem

Main images in posts were not scaling to fill the full width of the post component. Narrow images would display at their natural width with empty space on the sides, while wide images would correctly scale down. This inconsistency affected posts in:
- User feed
- User profile pages  
- Group pages

## Root Cause

The `PostMediaDisplay` component was using `object-contain` CSS class on main images, which:
- ✅ Scales wide images DOWN to fit container
- ❌ Does NOT scale narrow images UP to fill container  
- Results in narrow images not utilizing full width

### Before (Problematic Code)
```tsx
<LazyMedia
  className="w-full rounded-lg object-contain ..."
  style={{ aspectRatio: ... }}
/>
```

The `object-contain` CSS property maintains aspect ratio but ensures the entire image fits within the container, leaving empty space if the image is narrower than the container.

## Solution

Removed `object-contain` and used natural image scaling with `width: 100%` and `height: auto`. This ensures:
- Narrow images scale UP to fill container width ✅
- Wide images scale DOWN to fit container width ✅
- Aspect ratio is always maintained ✅
- No cropping ✅

### After (Fixed Code)
```tsx
<LazyMedia
  className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg ..."
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
/>
```

## Changes Made

Updated 4 image display sections in `components/common/post-media-display.tsx`:

### 1. Single Media Item (Line 192-216)
**Before**: `object-contain` with aspect ratio style  
**After**: `w-full h-auto` with simple width/height style

### 2. 2-3 Media Items (Line 255-270)
**Before**: `object-contain` with max-height and aspect ratio  
**After**: `w-full h-auto` with max-height (still respected)

### 3. Portrait Layout Main Image (Line 316-343)
**Before**: 
- Outer div had `flex justify-center` (shrinks to content)
- Image had `object-cover` with complex aspect ratio calculation  
**After**: 
- Removed `flex justify-center` from outer div
- Added `w-full` to inner drag container
- Image uses `w-full h-auto` with simple width/height style
- Now scales to full 80% width available

### 4. Landscape Layout Main Image (Line 434-448)
**Before**: `object-contain` with aspect ratio style  
**After**: `w-full h-auto` with simple width/height style

## Behavior

### Image Scaling
- **Narrow images**: Now scale UP to 100% of container width
- **Wide images**: Still scale DOWN to fit 100% of container width
- **Aspect ratio**: Preserved in all cases
- **No distortion**: Images maintain their proportions

### CSS Properties Used
```css
width: 100%;      /* Always fill container width */
height: auto;     /* Automatically calculate height to maintain aspect ratio */
```

This is the standard, reliable way to scale images responsively.

## Testing

### Scenarios Tested
1. ✅ Single portrait image → Scales to full width
2. ✅ Single landscape image → Scales to full width
3. ✅ Single square image → Scales to full width
4. ✅ Multiple images → Each scales appropriately
5. ✅ Video thumbnails → Still display correctly
6. ✅ Locked media placeholders → Unaffected

### Affected Components
All components using `PostMediaDisplay`:
- `components/dashboard/personal-feed.tsx` ✅
- `components/user-profile.tsx` ✅
- `components/group-profile.tsx` ✅

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

The browser's natural image scaling with `width: 100%` and `height: auto`:
1. Sets image width to 100% of parent container
2. Automatically calculates height based on image's intrinsic aspect ratio
3. No additional CSS interference (object-fit) needed
4. Works consistently across all browsers

### Portrait Layout Fix

The portrait layout (4+ images with portrait main image) required an additional fix:

**Problem**: The outer container had `flex justify-center`, which caused the inner div to shrink to the image's natural width. Even though the image had `width: 100%`, it was 100% of the shrunk container, not the full 80% available space.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `flex justify-center` from outer container
- Added `w-full` to inner drag container
- Now the image scales to the full 80% width allocated to the main image area

### Removed Properties
- `object-contain` class (was preventing upscaling)
- `object-cover` class (was cropping images)
- Complex `aspectRatio` inline styles (not needed with width/height auto)

### Kept Properties
- `w-full` (width: 100%)
- `h-auto` (height: auto)
- `rounded-lg` (border radius)
- `max-h-72` (maximum height limit for grid layouts - still works)

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent sizing**: All images fill container width  
✅ **No empty space**: Narrow images no longer have gaps  
✅ **Maintains quality**: No cropping or distortion  
✅ **Simpler code**: Removed complex aspect ratio calculations  
✅ **Better UX**: Posts look more polished and professional  
✅ **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes  

## Files Modified

- `frontend/components/common/post-media-display.tsx`

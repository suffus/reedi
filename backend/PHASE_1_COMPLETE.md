# Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETE ✓

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Facets and Permissions System implementation is now complete! All core infrastructure has been implemented and is ready for testing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `lineManagerId` field to User model for hierarchical management
- Added `Facet` model for facet definitions with hierarchy support
- Added `FacetAssignment` model for assigning facets to entities
- Added `FacetAssignmentHistory` model for full audit trail
- Added `PermissionAuditLog` model for permission decision logging
- Added `FacetAction` enum for tracking facet lifecycle events

### 2. ✅ Type Definitions (`src/types/permissions.ts`)
- `Authentication` interface for request context
- `PermissionResult` interface for permission check results
- `FacetIdentifier` interface for facet parsing
- `FacetWithAssignment` interface for facet queries
- `PermissionAuditOptions` interface for audit configuration

### 3. ✅ Core Permissions Library (`src/lib/permissions.ts`)
- `grant()` and `deny()` functions for permission results
- `auditPermission()` for logging decisions
- `safePermissionCheck()` for error handling (fail-closed)
- `requireAll()` and `requireAny()` for combining permissions
- `filterByPermission()` for filtering arrays by permissions

### 4. ✅ Facet Library (`src/lib/facets.ts`)
- `parseFacet()` and `facetToString()` for facet string handling
- `hasFacet()` to check if entity has a facet
- `getFacets()` to get all facets for an entity
- `getFacetValue()` to get specific facet value
- `hasFacetAtLevel()` for hierarchy checks
- `assignFacet()` and `revokeFacet()` with full audit trail
- Helper functions `userHasFacet()`, `userGetFacets()`, `userGetFacetValue()`

### 5. ✅ User Relations Library (`src/lib/userRelations.ts`)
- `isFriendsWith()` for friend relationship checks
- `isFollowing()` for follow relationship checks
- `isAdministratorFor()` for line management hierarchy (direct and indirect)
- `getDirectReports()` for immediate reports
- `getAllReports()` for entire reporting tree
- `shareDivision()` for organizational division checks

### 6. ✅ RabbitMQ Integration (`src/services/rabbitmqService.ts`)
- Added `initAuditChannel()` for permission audit logging
- Added `publishToQueue()` for async message publishing
- Added `consumeQueue()` for message consumption
- Added `closeAuditChannel()` for cleanup
- Graceful fallback to direct DB writes if RabbitMQ unavailable

### 7. ✅ Facet Seed Script (`prisma/seeds/facets.ts`)
- Seed for `reedi-admin:global` and `reedi-admin:divisional` facets
- Seed for `reedi-facet-admin:global` meta-facet
- Seed for `feature-access:locked-posts` facet
- Seed for user roles (admin, manager, director, hr-admin, moderator)
- Seed for divisions (engineering, sales, marketing, hr, finance)
- Seed for departments (development, design, qa, devops, product, etc.)

### 8. ✅ Unit Tests
- `__tests__/unit/permissions.test.ts` - Tests for core permission functions
- `__tests__/unit/facets.test.ts` - Tests for facet parsing and string conversion

## Important Note: Database Migration

**ACTION REQUIRED**: The Prisma schema changes need to be applied to the database. However, there's a configuration issue to resolve first:

Your schema uses `relationMode = "prisma"` which has limitations with self-referential relations (like `lineManagerId` on User). You have two options:

### Option 1: Remove relationMode (Recommended)
Remove or comment out the `relationMode = "prisma"` line in `schema.prisma`:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider     = "postgresql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  // relationMode = "prisma"  // Comment this out
}
```

This allows Prisma to use native PostgreSQL foreign keys and properly handle self-relations.

### Option 2: Accept Constraints
Keep `relationMode = "prisma"` but understand that some referential integrity is handled at the application level rather than database level.

## Next Steps

After resolving the schema configuration:

1. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Create Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npx prisma migrate dev --name add_facets_permissions_and_line_management
   ```

3. **Run Seed Script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npx ts-node prisma/seeds/facets.ts
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm test -- __tests__/unit/
   ```

Then we can proceed to **Phase 2: Authentication & Middleware**!

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/types/permissions.ts`
- `src/lib/permissions.ts`
- `src/lib/facets.ts`
- `src/lib/userRelations.ts`
- `prisma/seeds/facets.ts`
- `__tests__/unit/permissions.test.ts`
- `__tests__/unit/facets.test.ts`

### Modified Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added facets, permissions, and line management models
- `src/services/rabbitmqService.ts` - Added audit channel support

## Architecture Overview

```
Routes (users.ts, media.ts, etc.)
    ↓
Route-Specific Auth (src/auth/media.ts) [TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN PHASE 2]
    ↓
Core Permissions (src/lib/permissions.ts) ✓
    ↓
Facets System (src/lib/facets.ts) ✓
    ↓
User Relations (src/lib/userRelations.ts) ✓
    ↓
Database (Prisma) ⚠️ (needs migration)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Fail-Closed Security**: All errors in permission checks result in denial
2. **Full Audit Trail**: Facet assignments and permission decisions are logged
3. **Line Management**: Simple `lineManagerId` self-reference on User model
4. **Facet Format**: `scope:name:value` (value optional)
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Permission logic isolated from business logic

## What's Next: Phase 2

Phase 2 will implement:
- Authentication context builder middleware
- Route-specific permission files (`src/auth/media.ts`, `src/auth/posts.ts`, etc.)
- Facet management API routes
- Integration tests

# Media Uploader Performance Improvement Plan

## Problem Statement

The current media uploader has performance issues when handling large numbers of large files:
- UI becomes unresponsive during file processing
- No visual feedback during processing
- Memory issues from loading entire files into memory as base64
- Videos are loaded entirely into memory for thumbnail generation
- Sequential processing blocks the main thread

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Visual Feedback Strategy

#### Immediate Response
- Show "Processing files..." message with spinner as soon as files are selected
- Display file count and processing status immediately

#### Progress Indicators
- Show "Processing file X of Y" with progress bar
- For videos: "Generating thumbnail for [filename]..."
- For images: "Loading preview for [filename]..."
- File queue display with status indicators (pending, processing, complete, error)

#### User Experience
- Allow cancellation of processing
- Show file size warnings for very large files
- Resume capability if processing is interrupted

### 2. Memory Management Strategy

#### For Images
- **Streaming Thumbnails**: Use `createImageBitmap()` or `URL.createObjectURL()` instead of `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Revoke object URLs after thumbnail creation
- **Batch Processing**: Process images in small batches (5-10 at a time) with delays between batches

#### For Videos
- **Never Load Entire Video**: Use `URL.createObjectURL()` with `preload="metadata"` to only load headers
- **Thumbnail Generation**: 
  - Load only first few seconds using `video.currentTime = 0`
  - Capture frame when `canplay` event fires
  - Immediately revoke object URL after thumbnail creation
- **Lazy Processing**: Only generate thumbnails for visible videos

#### File Upload Strategy
- **Streaming Uploads**: Use `FormData` with `Blob` objects instead of base64 strings
- **Chunked Uploads**: For very large files, implement chunked uploads (1-5MB chunks)
- **Background Processing**: Process files in Web Worker to avoid blocking main thread

### 3. Implementation Approach

#### File Queue System
- Maintain a queue of files to process with configurable batch sizes
- Track processing status for each file
- Allow reordering and removal from queue

#### Memory Monitoring
- Track memory usage and pause processing if too high
- Implement garbage collection between batches
- Monitor browser memory warnings

#### Progressive Loading
- Show file list immediately with placeholder thumbnails
- Replace with real thumbnails as they're generated
- Implement virtual scrolling for large file lists

#### Error Recovery
- Skip failed files and continue processing
- Show error indicators with retry options
- Log errors for debugging

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Batch Processing Algorithm
```
1. Accept file selection
2. Immediately show file list with "Processing..." status
3. Queue files for processing
4. Process in batches of 5-10 files
5. Update UI after each batch
6. Allow user to continue while processing
```

#### Memory-Efficient Thumbnail Generation
```
For Images:
1. Create object URL from file
2. Create ImageBitmap or canvas
3. Generate thumbnail
4. Revoke object URL
5. Store thumbnail data

For Videos:
1. Create object URL from file
2. Create video element with preload="metadata"
3. Set currentTime = 0
4. Wait for canplay event
5. Capture frame to canvas
6. Revoke object URL immediately
7. Store thumbnail data
```

#### Upload Strategy
```
1. Use FormData with Blob objects
2. Implement chunked uploads for files > 10MB
3. Show upload progress per file
4. Allow pause/resume of uploads
5. Retry failed uploads automatically
```

### 5. Performance Targets

#### Response Time
- File selection feedback: < 100ms
- Initial file list display: < 200ms
- Thumbnail generation: < 2s per file
- Memory usage: < 100MB for 50 files

#### User Experience
- UI remains responsive during processing
- Clear progress indication
- Ability to cancel at any time
- Graceful error handling

### 6. Testing Strategy

#### Performance Testing
- Test with 100+ large files
- Monitor memory usage
- Measure processing time
- Test on low-end devices

#### User Experience Testing
- Test with various file types and sizes
- Test cancellation scenarios
- Test error recovery
- Test on different browsers

### 7. Rollout Plan

#### Phase 1: Visual Feedback
- Add immediate response indicators
- Implement progress bars
- Add file queue display

#### Phase 2: Memory Optimization
- Implement batch processing
- Add memory monitoring
- Optimize thumbnail generation

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add Web Worker processing
- Implement chunked uploads
- Add error recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 90% reduction in UI blocking time
- **Memory**: 80% reduction in peak memory usage
- **User Experience**: 95% user satisfaction with upload process
- **Reliability**: 99% successful upload completion rate

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Visual feedback improvements
- Progress indicators
- Basic batch processing

### Medium Risk
- Memory optimization changes
- Thumbnail generation improvements
- Error handling enhancements

### High Risk
- Web Worker implementation
- Chunked upload system
- Major architectural changes

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks
- **Total**: 9-13 weeks

## Resource Requirements

- Frontend developer: 100% for 9-13 weeks
- QA testing: 20% for 6-8 weeks
- UX review: 10% for 2-3 weeks
- Performance testing: 15% for 4-6 weeks
